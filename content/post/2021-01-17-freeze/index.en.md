FREEZE is a simple but effective warm up! You create a cue for instant silent stillness. Children practice responding to your cue. This routine ensures students can engage in many varieties of high energy dramatic movement safely. 

 

Let’s take a look at the FREEZE warm up in action:

Now let’s take it step-by-step! 

 

## Step 1 

Model the FREEZE routine.

This example uses a drum beat for the cue but feel free to consider alternatives that work for you.  Choose something you can repeat with clarity and consistency.   

 

## Step 2 

Invite a single volunteer to try responding to the FREEZE cue.

Young children may not be able to freeze their entire body simultaneously. That’s ok!  Take a moment to point out in an affirming way some part of the volunteer’s body that is successfully still (hand, arm, elbow, shoe etc). 

 

## Step 3 

Invite a second volunteer to respond to the FREEZE cue.

Once again, reinforce the intention of the FREEZE routine by drawing attention to a part of the volunteer’s body that was instantly silent and still. 

 

## Step 4 

Now invite the whole class to participate simultaneously.

Be sure to quickly name and affirm a success for each child before continuing on with the rest of the warm up. 

 

## Step 5 

Continue on with the warm up, adding variations such as body parts (arms, legs, head, shoulders etc.) or levels (up high, down low etc) or speed (fast and slow).

This can be a wonderful opportunity to introduce and reinforce new vocabulary.
