Freeze is a simple but effective warm up! You create a cue for instant silent stillness. Children practice responding to your cue. This routine ensures students can engage in (sometimes chaotic) dramatic movement safely.

## Step 1

Model the Freeze routine

## Step 2 

Invite a single volunteer to try responding to the Freeze cue

Young children may not be able to freeze every single body part. That is ok! Draw children's attention to some part of the volunteer's body that is frozen (hand, arm, elbow, shoe). 

## Step 3

Invite a new volunteer to respond to the Freeze cue

Once again, reinforce the intention of the Freeze routine by drawing attention to a part of the volunteer's body that was instantly silent and still.

## Step 4

Now invite the whole class.  

Be sure to name and affirm a success for each child before continuing on with the rest of the warm up.   

Add variations such as body parts (wiggle your arms, legs, head, shoulders etc.) or levels (wiggle up high, down low etc) or speed (wiggle fast and slow).  This is a wonderful opportunity to introduce and reinforce rich new vocabulary.
