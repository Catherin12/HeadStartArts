summary: 'How does the CLASS and other Head Start tools point to the same child milestones as arts-integration? This post provides some background on the tools you are already familiar with, and how to leverage your knowledge to encourage powerful language outcomes, especially for children who depend on Head Start for most of their language development.'

Think about a time you had to learn something new. Was there a new word you had to learn? Did you need to hear someone else say it before you could try it yourself? How much practice did you need before you felt confident you could use it in daily conversation? 

Children learn new words every day, and they learn them from hearing others use new words and then trying them on themselves. 

That is why effective early instruction standards guide teachers to encourage children to talk through effective questioning, expanding children’s involvement in conversations, expanding the range of a child’s visual, auditory, and movement opportunities.

Teachers are guided to provide hints and assistance, scaffolds that support children using new vocabulary words. Teachers are guided to encourage students to explain their thinking with follow-up questions and specific feedback on what they see a child doing or saying to communicate ideas and emotions.

Most people agree that young children need many opportunities for positive interaction with adults to develop healthy emotions and language skills. Children have these experiences with their adults who care for them, including parents and teachers. Teachers in Head Start gain insight in how to provide these experiences though standards in classroom interactions on the CLASS, and see their results when observing children, like with the DRDP or the TS Gold. But how do we plan these interactions, and how do we make them fun, developmentally appropriate, and part of our regular classroom routines? 

One way is to integrate arts-based instruction into our regular instruction.

We created this series of videos for you! They model basic drama techniques. You can use these videos while you plan your own lessons integrating arts into your work with children. We have included step by step moves, from planning to implementation, for how to integrate verbal and non-verbal scaffolds that specifically support children as they wind their way toward literacy. 

We intend to help you make connections between socio-emotional and literacy outcomes embedded within your work with children, as they are represented in the CLASS.  We hope you will be able to integrate the techniques into your lesson plans. 

Not all play is equal. We all play to have fun - and a certain kind of play supports early literacy development - Play does not always mean social interaction. Playful interaction does not necessarily support early literacy. When a child's play is interactive and interpersonal, based on fantasy and enacted through verbal or non verbal communication - we call it "social pretend play," or "fantasy play," and it supports early literacy!
