Tip 1 

[Pending approval from CVHS insert image of one or more of our classrooms.] 

Make sure your classroom is set up to allow everyone to move safely in the space. 

 

Depending on the activity, sometimes this means making your traditional story circle larger than usual so students can stretch out arms from side to side without bumping into one another. 

 

Other times it means adjusting furniture placement to allow pathways for travel. 

 

Tip 2

Introduce the word “imagination” by inviting them to share stories of how and what they like to pretend. 

[sentence frame here] 

As they share their stories, highlight times they used their bodies or voices in their pretending. [setence frame here] 

 

Tip 3 

Create a cue to use whenever you want to signal your students to copy or “echo” someone’s voice or actions.

It takes a bit of trial and error to find a cue that works for you and your students. 

 

It’s important to find something comfortable for you. Consistency is critical to help children avoid confusion. Eventually you and your class fall into a familiar rhythm which is especially helpful for dual language learners. 

 

Tip 4 

Drama gets exciting so consider establishing your own consistent calming routine(s) with the students to have in place to use when needed.

Tip 5 

[Pending approval from CVHS insert video of whole class involvement from one of our classrooms.] 

Whenever possible, ask all adults in the room to participate with in these fun activities so that together you can model high engagement for the students.
