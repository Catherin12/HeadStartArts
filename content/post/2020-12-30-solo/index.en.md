Solo allows you guide your students through a portion of a story plot while they imagine that they a main character. Use SOLO when your story has a main who enacts a sequence of physical actions, like the Very Hungry Caterpillar who eats lots of food, builds a chrysalis then emerges as a flying butterfly.

Another good example is Max from Where the Wild Things Are, who stares into the eyes of the Wild Things then dances, swings from trees, and marches with them.

## Step 1

Choose a story

## Step 2

Write a sequence of active prompts following the physical actions of the main character.

You can see in this script example, it helps to begin each line of the narrative with an active verb. In a traditional narrative pantomime students do not make sound, but in some instances it can work nicely to add a brief repetitive line for the character to speak aloud.

## Step 3

Read the book to the children.

Your group should be familiar with the story from previous readings. Before reading, tell the group they will soon pretend to be this character. Encourage everyone to pay special attention to what the character does in the story as you read.

## Step 4 (optional)

Depending on the need of your students, model the acting out of the solo for the students.

If you have dual language learners in your classroom is can be very helpful to model the solo for them first.  There are a couple of ways to do this.  You can model it yourself by telling the narrative in first person and acting it out as you talk, for example "I am the gingerbread boy.  You wouldn't believe what happened to me the other day.. I was a ball of dough... " or if you're lucky you might have another adult caregiver in the room willing to pantomime the actions, following your prompts as you read the narrative for them."  Either way, very young students appreciate the chance to see an adult in their life willing to take a risk and being playful and dramatic.

## Step 5

Give everyone enough room to move!

You want to make sure every student has a specific spot on the floor where they have a bubble of space around them; where they will remain throughout their solo.  Some classrooms call this a "kinesphere". Generally, if while standing in their spot they can put their arms out in front, to their sides and behind them without touching another child they will have the space they need.  Sometimes we mark each student's spot on the floor with a piece of tape or a circle spot.  

## Step 6

Practice the challenging parts of the solo together.

Some of the moments in your solo are going to be more challenging than others for the students to act out.  It's a good idea to try identify what they are ahead of time and give the students a chance to practice them before the solo begins. In this instance the teaching artist identified things like showing you are a lump of dough, running fast without leaving your spot, getting eaten up, and saying the line "Catch me if you can!"  The ECHO warm up that we taught you in a previous video can be very helpful here.  A few rounds of ECHO can also give you an opportunity to remind the children that the don't have to copy the model that you just demonstrated exactly.  Rather, remind them that you hope they will act out the story in their own unique and different way.  

## Step 7

Narrate the solo while they act it out

You really want to keep your eye on the students as they pantomime the solo.  Sometimes they need more time and so you might find yourself repeating the same word or line several times... like "You run! and run! and run!" Other times you will discover that they're getting tired sooner than you expected so you might find yourself editing a few moments out of your originally planned script.  Be a storyteller! If you bring enthusiasm and engagement to your narration they will be inspired to put that energy into their performances.  We describe SOLOs as "parallel play" in that the students are all performing simultaneously but not interacting with one another; consequently they're a great low risk way for all students to become performers in the classroom because there is no audience watching them to make them feel self-conscious.  Depending on the story, sometimes they are slow and gentle, other times they can be a terrific cardio experience.  For highly active SOLOs it can be helpful to begin them in a moment of stillness, and then return gradually to stillness at the end so that the students have a time to cool down.

## Step 8

Remember and re-enact favorite moments.

Depending on the needs and age of the class, it can work well to reflect after the SOLO by ask "What is choice you made that you liked from your solo?‚Äù If the language in their answer is incomplete, take a moment to expand on their answer before inviting the volunteer to perform their moment for the class.  

## Or... perform the solo for one another again.

Other times, particularly with older students it works well to divide the class in half with students on one side of the room being audience and the other side being performers on the stage.  Have the performers perform the solo again for the audience, invite the audience to tell the performers what they likes about their pantomime before switching places so that everyone has had a chance to act out the solo in front of an audience.
