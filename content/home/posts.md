We created this series of videos for you! They model basic drama techniques. You can use these videos while you plan your own lessons integrating arts into your work with children. We have included step by step moves, from planning to implementation, for how to integrate verbal and non-verbal scaffolds that specifically support children as they wind their way toward literacy. 

We intend to help you make connections between socio-emotional and literacy outcomes embedded within your work with children, as they are represented in the CLASS.  We hope you will be able to integrate the techniques into your lesson plans.
